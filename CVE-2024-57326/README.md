# CVE-2024-57326: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Online Pizza Delivery System

## Information
**Description:** A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the search.php file of the Online Pizza Delivery System project. 
**Versions Affected:**  1.0.0
**Version Fixed:** NULL
**Researcher:** Fatih Tüzün


## Proof-of-Concept Exploit
### Description
The vulnerability originates in the search.php file, specifically the following unsanitized code:

```
<h1>Your search - <em>"' .$_GET['search']. '"</em> - No Result Found.</h1>
```
This code directly reflects user-supplied input from the search GET parameter into the HTML response without applying proper input sanitization or encoding. As a result, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

### Usage/Exploitation
To demonstrate the issue, we entered the payload <script>alert(document.cookie)</script> into the search input box and confirmed that the XSS vulnerability was triggered.

The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request containing a malicious payload injected into the search parameter.
